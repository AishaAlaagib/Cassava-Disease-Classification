# Cassava-Disease-Classification
It is kaggle computation and it is still running. Now our score is with the five top scores.

The dataset consists of leaf images of the cassava plant, with 9,436 annotated images and 12,595 unlabeled images 
of cassava leaves. Participants can choose to use the unlabeled images as additional training data. The goal is to 
learn a model to classify a given image into these 4 disease categories or a 5th category indicating a healthy leaf,
using the images in the training data.
